      <h1>What is a team battle?</h1>
      <p>
        Team battle is a fighting game set variant that can be played in any 1-on-1 game with multiple different
        characters. Before starting, each player creates a team of two or more characters. Then, individual games are
        played where the winning character is awarded a crown. This continues until a player wins by crowning all of
        their characters. The catch? The characters are picked randomly for each match.
      </p>
      <p>
        After playing a character, it's removed from the random pool. If a player has no available characters left, all
        non-crowned characters become available again.
