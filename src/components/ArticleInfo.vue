      <h1>What is a Team Battle?</h1>
      <p>
        Team Battle, originally a game mode in
        <a href="https://www.fantasystrike.com/">Fantasy Strike</a>,
        is a fighting game set variant that can be played in any 1&#8209;on&#8209;1 fighting game with multiple
        different characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before starting, each player creates a team of two or more characters. Then, individual games are played where
        the winning character is awarded a crown. This continues until either player has crowned all of their characters
        and wins the battle. The catch? The characters are picked randomly for each match.
      </p>
      <p>
        After playing a character, it's removed from a pool of available characters. If a player has no available
        characters left, all non-crowned characters are returned to back the pool.
