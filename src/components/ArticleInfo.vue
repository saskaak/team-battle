      <h1>What is a team battle?</h1>
      <p>
        Team battle is a fighting game set variant that can be played in any 1-on-1 game that has multiple different
        characters. Before starting, each player creates a team of two or more characters. Then, individual games are
        played where the winning character is awarded a crown. This continues until either player has crowned all of
        their characters and wins the battle. The catch? The characters are picked randomly for each match.
      </p>
      <p>
        After playing a character, it's removed from a pool of available characters. If a player has no available
        characters left, all non-crowned characters are returned to back the pool.
